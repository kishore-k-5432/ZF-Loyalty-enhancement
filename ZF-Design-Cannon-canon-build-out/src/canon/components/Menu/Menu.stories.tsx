/**
 * **THE MENU.** Four things the source could not hold, in the order §7 puts them.
 *
 * **Press `↓` past the last row.** It wraps. A menu wraps; a listbox does not.
 *
 * **Type "ref" quickly** — it jumps to Refresh List. Wait a second and press "r"
 * and it starts a new search from the *next* row, so pressing "r" repeatedly
 * walks the r's rather than sticking on the first one. 500ms window.
 *
 * **Tab while it is open.** Nothing inside takes focus: §8 makes the panel the
 * only tabbable node and names the active row with `aria-activedescendant`. That
 * way Escape always has a focused element to return from, a disabled row can be
 * active without being tabbable, and the browser never scrolls a row behind the
 * trigger. The cost is paid explicitly — `scrollIntoView({block:'nearest'})` on
 * every move, because activedescendant does not scroll and the md measured the
 * active row 197px below the panel after 20 keystrokes.
 *
 * **Press and hold on a row, then release outside.** It does not dismiss.
 * `pointerdown` beats `click`, because that gesture is a drag.

/**
 * **THE FLYOUT, and the two invisible things holding it up.**
 *
 * **Sweep the pointer straight down across three submenu rows.** Nothing opens —
 * a 150ms intent absorbs it. Without that, a submenu fires every time the
 * pointer crosses its row on the way somewhere else.
 *
 * **Now hover `Export`, then move diagonally into the flyout.** It stays open.
 *
 * That one needs more than a corridor, and the md proves it: sampling the
 * straight line from a parent row's centre to the flyout's third row, the path
 * **crosses two sibling rows inside the panel**, each arming its own 150ms timer
 * that closes the flyout. Measured — hovering "Sort by" then "Preferences"
 * closed it every time, *with a 12px corridor in place*. What works is a **safe
 * triangle** from the pointer's last position to the flyout's near edge: inside
 * it, another row's timer is 300ms instead of 150.
 *
 * **The flyout opens RIGHT and flips left.** The source only ever draws the
 * flipped case, because its trigger sits at the right of a page header — and a
 * component that can only open left breaks the first time it is used on the left
 * of a screen. The **1px overlap** is the source's own fine judgement (it drew
 * 0.86) and it is kept.

/**
 * **THE ACTIVE ROW, and why it is not filled blue.**
 *
 * The source fills its one active row `#408DFB` with white text — **3.27:1**, a
 * 1.4.3 failure at 13px, on the row the design most wants you to look at. It
 * clears 1.4.11 at 3.0, which is exactly why it looks fine in a screenshot. And
 * `#408DFB` is **4.79 ΔE from `#528EF4`**, the caret's blue eight nodes away in
 * the same drawing: the same intended colour drawn twice, neither owned. Seventh
 * appearance of that blue across the file.
 *
 * Here the active row is `surface/hover` with `text/default` — **14.05:1** — plus
 * a 2px inset `focus/ring` at **4.00:1** on that fill.
 *
 * **The ring is not decoration.** `surface/hover` against the panel is 1.08 / 1.07;
 * as a hover cue that is fine and every component in the system uses it, but
 * 2.4.7 wants a *visible* focus indicator and 1.4.11 sets 3:1. So the fill says
 * *the pointer or the keyboard is here* and the ring says *the keyboard is here* —
 * different facts, and a menu shows both at once, because a pointer can rest on
 * row 3 while the keyboard owns row 7.

 * **DANGER, DISABLED, AND CHECKED.**

 * in Dark — `red/2000` against `neutral/2000`, luminances within a rounding
 * error — so a danger row would have **no hover state at all**. Verified. The
 * md's own Figma build shipped nine variants on it before catching this.
 *
 * **A disabled row is focusable.** Arrow onto it: it is reachable, announced, and
 * Enter does nothing. `aria-disabled`, never the native `disabled`, which removes
 * the button from the accessibility tree — *a disabled row the keyboard skips is
 * a disabled row nobody can discover.* Disabled also beats destructive: a
 * disabled danger row is `text/disabled`, not red.
 *
 * **`checked` makes the row a `menuitemcheckbox`** and puts `icon/check` in the
 * trailing slot. It is a glyph and not a fill, because `surface/selected` is
 * 1.13 / **1.02** and cannot carry that on its own — §11 decision 6.

/**
 * **GEOMETRY — 240 / 232 / 160.**
 *
 * The panel is **240 fixed**, not `max-content`: left to hug, the md's rebuild
 * measured **180.00, 204.50 and 201.53** on three different sets of labels, two
 * of them fractional, so every row edge and glyph landed on a half pixel.
 *
 * **The edge is an inset `box-shadow`, not a `border`.** Figma's `INSIDE` stroke
 * does not consume layout and a `box-sizing: border-box` CSS border does — at 240
 * a 1px border gives a **230px row and a 158px label** where §3.3 needs 232 and
 * 160. `shadow/menu` carries both halves: the elevation and the inset ring.
 *
 * **The row is 32, not the source's 34.** 34 is what 13/AUTO produces — Inter at
 * 13px with automatic leading measures 15.73, the node rounds to 16, and
 * 9 + 16 + 9 = 34. Nobody chose it. 6 + 20 + 6 = 32 is the row height
 * `zf-header-action`, `zf-header-cta` and `zf-header-switcher` already use.
 *
 * **Put a 200-character label in a row** and it truncates at 160, the row stays
