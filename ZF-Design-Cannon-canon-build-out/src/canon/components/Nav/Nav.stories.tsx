/**
 * THE FULL RAIL. `Sales` is the open parent and `Retainer Invoices` is the
 * current page, which is the exact state Figma draws.
 *
 * **§5.2 — a parent that is active is not the same thing as a leaf that is
 * active, and that distinction is the best idea in the state model.** A leaf
 * that is active is *the page you are on*: `brand/solid`, `aria-current="page"`.
 * A parent that is active *contains* the page you are on: a tint plus **Semi
 * Bold**, and no `aria-current`.
 *
 * The weight is load-bearing. The tint alone is 1.42:1, which cannot carry a
 * state — and §10.1 found the doc frame crediting an "active bar" for the 1.4.1
 * pass that had been **deleted three sections earlier in the same document**.
 * The verdict survives only because Semi Bold is a non-colour cue.
 *
 * **§3.2 — the slot grid.** Measure the label's x on a parent, a leaf and a
 * child: all three are **48**, with no per-row arithmetic. Every row renders
 * both slots — a 14px chevron slot and a 24px icon slot — filled or empty. A
 * child's icon slot is `visibility: hidden`, reserved rather than removed.
 *
 * **Hover `Documents`.** The plus appears. Then hide the mouse and Tab to it —
 * it must appear on focus too, or a keyboard user cannot reach a control that
 * is in the tab order. It is 24×24 here; Figma's is **20×20** and fails 2.5.8
 * with no exception available.

/**
 * **COLLAPSED — 72px. Three things Figma leaves to code, and all three are here
 * now.**
 *
 * **1. The submenu marker.** §3.3: a 5.89 × 5.89 vector at the bottom-right
 * corner of a collapsed row — *"the only signal that a collapsed row opens a
 * flyout rather than navigating"*. Look at the bottom-right of **Sales**; no
 * other row has one. Its contrast is fine (7.69 / 7.12); §11 decision 4
 * questions the **size**, since 5.89px is smaller than the 1px borders this
 * system rejects at 1.31:1.
 *
 * **2. The flyout — hover a parent to open it.** §5.6: Figma's `zf-nav-flyout`
 * is a floating rectangle with no anchor, no pointer and no close affordance,
 * so the anchoring, the opening and the closing are all code-only.
 *
 * **Hover Sales.** The menu appears and the row takes a **grey tint** — not the
 * brand solid. Those two states must not collide: the solid means *this is
 * where you are*, an open menu means *this is what you are pointing at*, and if
 * hovering painted a row blue every pass of the mouse would look like a
 * navigation. Only the current page's row is blue.
 *
 * **Slide the pointer across the 8px gap into the menu.** It stays open — there
 * is a 180ms grace period, because crossing that gap fires `pointerleave` on
 * the row before `pointerenter` on the flyout and an immediate close would make
 * the menu unreachable by mouse. Slide from Sales straight onto another parent
 * and the menu switches rather than closing.
 *
 * It is a **menu**, not a popover (§8): one tab stop, arrow keys inside,
 * **Escape or ArrowLeft closes it and returns focus to the row**. Thirteen
 * collapsed parents × five children would otherwise be 78 tab stops. Click
 * still works, for touch and for the keyboard, where Enter and Space both
 * dispatch a click.
 *
 * The flyout's rows use `Indent=flush` with `Show icon=false`, so their labels
 * sit at the same 16px as the header. §3.2's measured "label x = 40" for a
 * flush row includes an icon slot this configuration does not render.
 *
 * **3. The truncated labels.** The label is 10px and truncates at 42px. In
 * Figma's own export **seven of thirteen rows** are ambiguous: *Invent… ·
 * Purch… · Time… · Filing… · Accou… · Docu… · **Custo…***. That last is the
 * worst — the rail also holds a real `Customers` row. Hover any row: `title`
 * and `aria-label` carry the full name.
 *
 * Finally, click the toggle. The glyph flips via `scaleX(-1)`; Figma uses
 * `rotation: 180`, a double flip that works only because that glyph happens to
 * be vertically symmetric.

 *   three `State` values on the toggle — no focus at all — on the rail's *last
 *   tab stop*. That is a 2.4.7 failure the doc frame grades as PASSES.
 * - **Tab onto a row and measure it: still 30px.** The ring is inset, so the box
 *   is identical focused and unfocused.
 * - **Tab onto the active blue row: the ring is white, not blue.** It recolours
 *   to `brand/on-solid`. Blue-on-blue would be **1.27:1**.
 * - **Tab onto the active *parent* (the tinted `Sales` row).** `focus/ring` on
 *   `nav/item-selected` is **2.82:1 in Light** — the one failing focus pair in
 *   all 54 variants, and it is reachable on the most important row in the rail.
 *
 * Then try it in **forced-colors / Windows High Contrast**. The md's §9.2 draws
 * this ring as an `inset box-shadow` and needs a separate `forced-colors` block,
 * because that mode forces `box-shadow: none` — it measured **zero ring pixels**
 * without one. A negative `outline-offset` gets the same inset ring, follows the
 * border radius, and *is* painted in forced-colors, so no fallback is needed.

/**
 * **THE TWO AXES — pane × hue, four renderings from one instance.**
 *
 * §4.2: the pane lives in `ZF Semantic` (Light/Dark) and the hue in `ZF Brand`
 * (Blue/Red), as two independent collections. The md is right that this is the
 * first time the file applies one-axis-one-dimension at the *collection* level.
 *
 * **But separating the axes did not stop a hue swap from changing whether the
 * component passes.** §4.4 / defect 14 — check the active row against the rail:
 *
 * | | Light | Dark |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `brand/solid` vs `nav/surface`, **Blue** | 5.08 | **2.77** ✗ |
 * | `brand/solid` vs `nav/surface`, Red | 4.33 | 3.25 ✓ |
 * |
 *
 * So in **Dark + Blue** the current page's row does not clear 3:1 against the

 * most interesting" open question, because it is the one place the pane × hue
 * split turns out to be insufficient: it stopped the duplication, not the
 * conformance drift.
 *
 * Also worth a look while you are here: **the rail's edge.** §2 — Figma draws
 * none, and `nav/surface` against the page is **1.08:1 Light and 1.07:1 Dark**,
 * failing in *both* modes, which is rare. This uses `nav/border`, the role Figma
 * created for exactly this and bound on one node in the whole file — 1.31
 * against the page. `border/control` would be 4.52.

/**
 * **THE PINNED TOGGLE — §3.4, and the reason this needed fixing rather than
 * flagging.**
 *
 * Both Figma rails are `FIXED / HUG` vertically and the body is `FILL / HUG`
 * with `layoutGrow: 0`, so the collapse bar is the last child of a *hugging*
 * column. The only thing putting space between the last row and the bar is the
 * body's bottom padding: **56px full, 52px collapsed** — a hand-made spacer for
 * a sibling, and both numbers are off the spacing scale and unbound.
 *
 * Three consequences: in a tall viewport the toggle floats mid-screen; in a
 * short one it is pushed off; and the two views have different heights (836 and
 * 1000) for no reason.
 *
 * **Resize this frame.** The toggle stays at the bottom, the body scrolls, and
 * the logo band stays put. And there is **no dead space above the toggle** —
 * copying Figma's 56px would leave 56px of empty scroll at the end of the list.
 *
 * The doc frame's §07 already says *"height fills the viewport in use"*. Nothing
 * in the component expressed it.
