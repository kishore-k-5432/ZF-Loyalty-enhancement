/**
 * SALES → INVOICES → one invoice. The split view.
 *
 * `MiniList` on the left, the record on the right, and `SplitView` holding the
 * two so neither scrolls the other — which is the whole reason the pattern
 * exists: `zf-mini-list.md` §5 is that *"selecting a row does not re-render,
 * scroll, or lose its position."*
 *
 * The right column is the same `PageChrome` the list view uses, so §12's three
 * rules hold here too — one fixed cell, the header hidden rather than
 * unmounted, focus never crossing the swap. What changes is which header sits in
 * it: `type="detail"`, so the record gets a back control and a parent link
 * rather than a view switcher.
 *
 * **The bulk selection lives on the LEFT and its action bar appears on the
 * RIGHT.** That is `zf-mini-list.md` §5's own row — *"the action bar replaces
 * the page header, and here the page header is on the right"* — and it is the
 * reason the two selections have to stay separate: reading one invoice while
 * three others are ticked is a normal thing to be doing.
 */

/**
 * ONE map, used by the badge in the card and the badge in the mini list — and
 * the same one `Invoices.tsx` gives the table. A status that is orange in the
 * list and red in the detail is two facts about one record.
 *
 * `Overdue` is the **orange** `overdue` badge — `#FAEEE3` on `#964600`, 5.80:1
 * — not a red one. Red is `cancelled` and `failed`: things that ended badly. An
 * invoice overdue by 30 days is still collectable, and the colour should say
 * "attend to this", not "this is over".
